import time     TIPS :
                # Code is written in PyCharm IDE, i have tested this code if it does'nt work then fix yourself.
                # We have imported time module to give more real feel to our program, time module wait for given seconds
                # before executing other line of code.
                # In this code i have intentionally not written code ..like for pepperoni( you will understand it later), so try it out yourslf.
                # Use '-' where it is written.
